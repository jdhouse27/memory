# Memory
* A interactive game app to test your memory skills

## Website
https://jdhouse27.github.io/memory/.

## Purpose:
To design the classic memory game with REACT.

## How to use:
Simply click on any character.  Each time a user clicks on a chacter the board will dynamically reposition and the user can select the next character.  User continues to click on a superhero until they either have clicked on every character once, in which they win the game.  If the user clicks on the same character twice before clicking on all characters then they loose the game.

## Functionality to add:
* I would like to add sound to help assist with correct vs incorrect guess
* I would like to make the cards shake with each click
